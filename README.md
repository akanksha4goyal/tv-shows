## Installing Node and Angular

Run command `node --version` and `npm --version` on command prompt. If it shows version then node is installed in the system and if it gives an error then node needs to be installed. You can download it from `https://nodejs.org/en/download/` and after installing again check for its version.

Run command `ng --version` on command prompt. If it shows version then angular CLI is installed in the system and if it gives an error then run command `npm install -g @angular-cli` to install angular CLI.
